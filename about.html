        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="muted">The goal is to make an app that helps people get healthier and fitter while keeping everything easy to use and enjoyable.</p>

            <h2>The App</h2>
            <p class="muted">Invictum Fitness</p>
            <p>
                This app started as a school project.
                The goal was simple: build something functional, clean, and genuinely useful.
            </p>
            <p>While working on it, I realized there was much more potential. What began as an assignment slowly turned
                into a personal project and eventually into a real app.</p>

            <p>Over time, features were refined, design choices became more intentional, and the focus shifted from
                “just building” to actually helping people stay consistent with training and nutrition.</p>
            <p>
                Today, the app continues to evolve. Not as a finished product, but as something that grows through
                learning, feedback, and real use.
            </p>
            <p>
                No social feed. No distractions. Just progress.
            </p>

            <h2>Myself</h2>
            <p class="muted">Lucas</p>
            <p>I've always enjoyed training and staying active.
                Like many others, I used apps to track workouts and nutrition, but I kept running into the same
                problem.</p>
            <p>Workouts were in one app. Nutrition in another. Progress spread across multiple places.</p>
            <p>On top of that, many essential features were locked behind paywalls. Things that felt basic like tracking,
                insights, overviews often required a subscription.</p>
            <p>I wanted something different. One app where workouts and nutrition come together in a single, clear
                overview. No unnecessary complexity, and no paid barriers for the things that truly matter.</p>
            <p>This app is built around that idea: keep the essentials accessible, free, and easy to use so staying
                consistent doesn't depend on subscriptions or multiple tools.</p>
