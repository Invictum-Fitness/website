        <section class="card" id="template">
            <h2>Templates</h2>
            <p><strong>Templates</strong> can be a quick way to start your workouts. But what are they?</p>
            <div>
                <p class="muted">
                    Explanation
                </p>
                <p>A template is a blueprint for your workout. If you like training the same thing, templates make your
                    life a lot easier. Instead of having to add each exercise over and over again, you can now make a
                    blueprint with the exercises you want to do and the amount of sets.
                </p>
                <p>For example: You have a chest
                    day with 4 exercises that you never change. You can add those 4 exercises to a template and select
                    the amount of sets for each exercise. By starting the workout with a template, all exercises and
                    sets will already be in the workout.</p>
                <p>While creating a template you can add exercises with the 'Add Exercise' button. When an exercise is
                    added, each exercise will show a number with a + and - button next to it. The number represents the
                    amount of sets. Control the amount of sets with the + and - buttons next to it. To remove an
                    exercise, simply just swipe right!</p>
                <p>You can create as many templates as you want for <strong>free!</strong></p>
