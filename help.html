                    It's important to keep track of your personal records(PR's). By clicking on this button the app
                    takes you
                    to the Personal Records Screen. Here you can select an exercise to view your PR's during
                    a specific time. You can use the Month - Year slider in the top right, to change the period.
                    Changing it to month will show you on what day during that month you've achieved a PR
                    for the selected exercise. Changing it to year will show you the highest PR of each month.

                    Whether you're losing or gaining weight, it's important to keep track of this. In the Weight Screen
                    you get a perfect overview of your weight for each day and month. This let's you go back in time to
                    see the progress you've made. It's <strong>important</strong> that you always weigh yourself at the
                    same time of each day. The best time to weigh yourself is before you have breakfast. It's normal to
                    see fluctuations in your weight even when you're trying to lose some kilo's. You have to look at the
                    bigger picture and the charts lets you do that.

            <h2>Templates</h2>
            <p><strong>Templates</strong> can be a quick way to start your workouts. But what are they?</p>
            <div>
                <p class="muted">
                    Explanation
                </p>
                <p>A template is a blueprint for your workout. If you like training the same thing, templates make your
                    life a lot easier. Instead of having to add each exercise over and over again, you can now make a
                    blueprint with the exercises you want to do and the amount of sets.
                </p>
                <p>For example: You have a chest
                    day with 4 exercises that you never change. You can add those 4 exercises to a template and select
                    the amount of sets for each exercise. By starting the workout with a template, all exercises and
                    sets will already be in the workout.</p>
                <p>While creating a template you can add exercises with the 'Add Exercise' button. When an exercise is
                    added, each exercise will show a number with a + and - button next to it. The number represents the
                    amount of sets. Control the amount of sets with the + and - buttons next to it. To remove an
                    exercise, simply just swipe right!</p>
                <p>You can create as many templates as you want for <strong>free!</strong></p>
